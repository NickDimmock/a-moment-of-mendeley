# Citing multiple items

You may need to cite two or more sources in a single citation. For example:

> ...others believe a more complex relationship exists (Philips, 1995; Norton, 2005).

## Using Mendeley Desktop tools

If you're using the citation tools installed by Mendeley Desktop, follow the normal steps to add your first citation. Instead of clicking **OK** to return to Word, repeat the same steps to add a second citation. When you've added all the citations you need, click **OK**.

## Using Mendeley Cite

In Mendeley Cite, search for and tick all the citations you want to include before clicking the **Insert citations** button. You can see the citations you've selected so far at the top of the Mendeley Cite window.
