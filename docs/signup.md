# Create a Mendeley account

Mendeley accounts can be created on the Mendeley website at [https://www.mendeley.com/](https://www.mendeley.com/).

You'll need to provide an email to create an account. I recommend using a personal email for this, as accounts that use your university email have some restrictions.

There's no charge for creating a Mendeley account. Free accounts come with 2gb of PDF storage space, which nobody to my knowledge has needed to go beyond. You can check how much space you've used at [https://www.mendeley.com/settings/subscription/](https://www.mendeley.com/settings/subscription/).

Remember your password - you'll need to use it to log into Mendeley Desktop.
