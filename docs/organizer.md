# File Organizer

The **File Organizer** tools in Mendeley Desktop are very useful if you like to work with article PDFs. Once you turn them on, Mendeley will automatically rename and file all your PDFs into a single folder on your computer.

This is a great help if you want to find or use the PDFs outside of Mendeley, and it also gives you a convenient source for a manual backup of you files. It also solves the problem of identifying PDFs with unhelpful names like **e45_6873_2.pdf**.

To turn the Organizer tools on, open Mendeley Desktop and go to **File > Options** in Windows, or **Mendeley Desktop > Preferences** in macOS.

Click the **File Organizer** tab in the Options window and tick all three boxes on the left ((Organize my files, Sort files into subfolders, and Rename document files).

In the first section, **Organize my files**, you'll see a location on your computer. By default this should be inside your standard Documents folder, but you can change it to another location if you like.

?> As Mendeley will copy all your PDFs to its own cloud service, it's best to avoid setting this to an online folder like OneDrive or Dropbox, as you may find it uses up at lot of your storage.

The other default settings are a good selection for most users.

Click **OK** to save the settings. Mendeley will now:

- Copy all the PDFs you add into the folder you've selected
- Organise the PDFs into folders by author surname and journal title
- Rename the PDFs using the author name, year and article title
  - e.g. **e45_6873_2.pdf** becomes **Smith-2019-Writing your literature review.pdf**

This will be applied to all existing PDFs in Mendeley, and any future additions.If you change the File Organizer settings later, Mendeley will reorganise your PDFs to match the new settings.
