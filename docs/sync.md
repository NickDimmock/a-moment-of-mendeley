# Sync your library

If you're using Mendeley Desktop you'll need to sync in order to make sure you online library and device library are both up-to-date.

Syncing also copies your PDFs to your online library, creating backups that can be accessed from any device or web browser.

Desktop will sync when you launch it, but you can also sync at any time by clicking the **Sync** button in the toolbar.

?> If you've added a new PDF to Desktop, you'll need to sync to view the details online. Similarly, if you've saved a citation online (e.g. with the Web Importer), you'll need to sync in order to see it in Mendeley Desktop.

If you can't see a citation you think should be there, try syncing.

## Mendeley Cite

If you're using Mendeley Cite, use **More > Refresh References** to pick up any changes or additions to your library. If you've made changes in Mendeley Desktop, you need to sync there first.
