# Entering corporate authors

Corporate authors (such as the World Health Organisation) can be tricky to add manually, because Mendeley Desktop assumes all authors are human unless you tell it otherwise. This can lead to author citations like **Organisation, W. H** instead of **World Health Organisation**.

To enter a corporate author, go to the authors box in the item details and enter the full name (e.g. **World Health Organisation**). Don't hit enter at the end - instead, look below the text box, where you should see the text **World Health Organisation (Institution / Organization)**. Click this text to store the record as a corporate author. You can also use the down arrow on your keyboard to highlight the text and click enter to save it.

?> In the web library, just enter one author per line. Add corporate authors in full (e.g. **World Health Organisation**) and use the format **Surname, Forename** for human authors.
