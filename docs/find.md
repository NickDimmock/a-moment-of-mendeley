# Finding your citations

There are several ways to find citations in Mendeley. This can be an important factor as your library grows.

## Folders

If you've organised your citations into folders, you can browse them in the left-hand panel.

## Tags

If you've added tags, they'll be included in search results in Mendeley Desktop and your Web Library, and also when you're adding a citation in Word using the Mendeley Desktop tools.

You can also browse your tags in Mendeley Desktop by changing the **Filter by Authors** list in the bottom left to **Filter by My Tags**. You can't browse tags in the Web Library.

## Search

Using the search box in Mendeley Desktop or the Web Library is a fast way to find items. It will search:

- Item metadata (title, authors, etc.)
- Full-text PDF contents
- Tags
- Notes added to the General Notes box

If you open a PDF from a search results list in Mendeley Desktop, your search term will be highlighted in the document, with **Previous** and **Next** buttons at the top to cycle through the results. The Web Library doesn't have this feature, but its PDF viewer does have a dedicated search box.
