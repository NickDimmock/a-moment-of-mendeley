# Adding page details

You may need to add page or page range details to an in-text citation. For example:

> The surveys took place in December 2018 (Smith, 2019, p.23) and January 2019 (Brown, 2020, pp.98-100).

## Using Mendeley Desktop tools

If you're using the citation tools installed by Mendeley Desktop, click an in-text citation and then go to the **References** ribbon and click **Edit Citation**.

?> On some devices the button may read **Insert / Edit Citation**.

An editing window will appear. Click the author's name for the citation you want to edit. This will expand the window with the citation editing form. The drop-down next to the first field should be set to **Page** - change it if not. Enter the page number or range, then click **OK**.

You'll be taken back to Word with your page details added.

?> There's no need to add **p** or **pp** - this will be added by Mendeley, depending on the referencing style used. Just add the page (e.g **23**) or range (**17-23**).

## Using Mendeley Cite

To add page details using Mendeley Cite, select the in-text citation in word and click the preview that appears under the **Edit Citation** box at the top of the window.

Make sure the first field is set to **Page** and enter the page (e.g **23**) or page range (**17-23**) in the box to the right.

?> No need to add **p** or **pp** - Mendeley will take care of this.

Click **Done** and then **Save changes** to apply the changes in Word.
