# Adding items

There are three basic ways to add an item to Mendeley

## Import a PDF

If you've downloaded an article PDF and want to add it to Mendeley, just open Mendeley Desktop and drag the PDF into the main window. You can add multiple PDFs at once, or just drag in a folder to add all the PDFs inside it.

?> You can also drag PDFs into the web version of Mendeley at [https://www.mendeley.com/library/](https://www.mendeley.com/library/).

After a second or so you should see the item details appear. Mendeley will extract as much citation information as possible from the PDF.

Most of the time this works well, but it depends on the quality of the data in the PDF. After importing PDFs, it's a good idea to [check the details](checking) and make any corrections that might be needed.

## Web Importer

Use the Web Importer to save anything you're viewing in your browser, such as web pages, journal articles or PDFs. If you need to cite a web page (e.g. a BBC News item), this is the best approach - Mendeley will automatically save the site address and the date of access.

?> See the Getting Started page for details on [installing the Web Importer](getting-started?id=web-importer).

After installing the importer you'll see a small Mendeley icon next to the address bar in your browser. Click this from any web page to start importing.

Web Importer will show you a list of all citable items it can find on the page. If you're looking at a journal article, for example, it may also find articles in the bibliography.

Tick any citations you want to save, and click **Add**. The items will be saved to your **Recently Added** folder in Mendeley, where you can [check the details](checking).

Web Importer will also try to save any related PDFs, but this depends on the access provided by the website. If a PDF was saved, you'll see **PDF &#10004;** under the details after saving.

?> If you want to make sure you have a PDF in Mendeley, it's best to download it and drag it into Mendeley Desktop.

## Manual entry

If all else fails or you don't have an online source, you can add a citation manually.

In Mendeley Desktop, go to the File menu and choose **Add Entry Manually**. A new item window will pop up.

On the Mendeley website, go to your [library](https://www.mendeley.com/library/), click the **Add** button and then **New manual entry**. The new item window will appear on the right of the page.

In both cases, be sure to select the right item type (e.g. journal article / book / book section) at the top of the form.

## Best practice

There isn't a perfect method for saving citations, because it depends on publisher practices and the quality of metadata for each item. Sometimes you'll get better results from the Web Importer, and other times from dragging in PDFs.

If you want to save PDFs to your library, dragging them into Mendeley is a good approach. If metadata is missing, you'll always have a copy of the source material that you can use to make corrections. It also means you can make use of Mendeley's PDF annotation tools.

The Web Importer is great for capturing citations for web pages and sites but, as with PDFs, Mendeley can only save what it can find. At the very least you'll have the web address and the access date, so you can view the site later if you need any additional information.
