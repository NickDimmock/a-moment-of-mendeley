# Managing your library

Over time, your Mendeley library may become very large. There are various ways of managing and organising your citations to help you find and use them later.

## Folders

### Creating folders

You can create folders to store your citations. In the left-hand panel under **My Library**, click **Create Folder...** at the end of the folder list.

You can also create subfolders. Either create a new folder and drag it into an existing one, or right-click an existing folder and select **New Folder...** from the pop-up menu.

?> To create subfolders in the web library, hover over an existing folder and click the three dots that appear to the right of the folder name.

### Using folders

To add a citation to a folder, just drag it over to the folder. You can add a citation to multiple folders - this is useful if you want to create folders for each chapter in a thesis, for example, where you may want to cite an item in several chapters.

!> This doesn't affect your storage - there's still only one citation, which the folders are linking to.

To remove an item from a folder, you can either highlight the item and hit delete / backspace on your keyboard, or right-click the item and select **Remove from folder**.

?> In the web library, tick the box to the right of a citation and then **X Remove from folder** in the menu bar.

!> If you're deleting using the keyboard in Mendeley Desktop, make sure you're viewing a folder. If you're viewing your **All Documents** list, you'll remove the citation from Mendeley instead. If you accidentally remove an item, you can restore it from the **Trash** list in the left-hand panel.

## Special folders

There are a number of built-in folders in Mendeley Desktop. Some of these also appear in the web library.

### All Documents

This shows everything in your library, and is the default view.

### Recently Added

This shows the latest citations you've imported. This is useful for reviewing the details of recent additions.

### Recently Read

This shows items where you've recently viewed the attached PDF.

### Favorites

Click the star icon to the left of a citation to add it to your Favorites. The star will turn gold and the citation will appear in this list. Click the star again to remove the item from your Favorites.

### Needs Review

Sometimes Mendeley will recognise that a citation may be missing some information, and will add it to this list.

Each item in the list will have a yellow box in its **Details** view. Click **Details are Correct** to tell Mendeley the citation is OK, or **Search** to have Mendeley automatically fill in any information it can.

This can be a good way of pulling in extra citation fields such as abstracts and DOIs. After running a search Mendeley will show a green tick next to the **Search** button. If the changes look OK, click **Details are Correct**.

You can also edit any missing fields yourself before clicking **Details are Correct**.

### My Publications

If you've written academic articles, Mendeley may find them and ask you to confirm you're the author. They'll be listed here.

### Unsorted

The **Unsorted** folder is useful if you want to make sure all your citations have been filed away. It shows all items in your library that aren't currently in a folder. If **Unsorted** is empty, you know everything has been filed!

## Tags

You can add tags to your citations, which will then be included in search results. To add a tag in Mendeley Desktop or the Web Library, use the Tags field when editing the citation details and separate tags with semi-colons.

In Mendeley Desktop you can browse your tags using the panel in the bottom left. Normally this shows a list of authors, but you can use the drop-down at the top to change this to **Filter by My Tags**.
