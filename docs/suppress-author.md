# Suppressing the author

Sometimes you may not want to show the author's name in a citation. For example:

> Terry Eagleton (1983) created an essential guide to literary theory...

When you add a standard citation using Mendeley, you'll see something like this:

> Terry Eagleton (Eagleton, 1983) created an essential guide to literary theory...

This can be fixed by suppressing the author.

## Using Mendeley Desktop tools

If you're using the citation tools added by Mendeley Desktop, start by clicking the in-text citation you want to edit.

Open the **References** ribbon and click **Edit Citation**. In the citation edit window, click the author's surname to show the editing form.

At the bottom of the form, tick **Suppress author** and then OK. Mendeley will update Word with your changes.

## Using Mendeley Cite

To suppress the author in Mendeley Cite, select the in-text citation and head to the Mendeley Cite window.

Click the preview of the citation a the top of the Cite window (under the **Edit Citation** box) to show the editing options.

Tick **Suppress author**, then click **Done** and then **Save changes** to update the citation in Word.
