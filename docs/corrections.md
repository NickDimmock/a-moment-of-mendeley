# Making corrections

Sometimes you may spot an error in your citations or your bibliography, such as a misspelled author or an incorrect date.

You should correct these in Mendeley, rather than in Word, to ensure that all references are updated and won't occur in future.

?> If you click on a Mendeley citation or bibliography in Word, it will be highlighted as a reminder not to edit the text in Word. Using the Desktop citation tools, the background of the citation will turn grey. If you're using Mendeley Cite a box will appear around the text.

## Using Mendeley Desktop tools

If you're using the citation tools installed by Mendeley Desktop, find the item you want to edit in Desktop and make your changes. Head back to Word and go to the Mendeley section of the **References** ribbon, and click **Refresh**.

?> You can also edit the details in your Web Library, but you'll need to sync Mendeley Desktop before refreshing Word.

## Using Mendeley Cite

If you're using Mendeley Cite you can edit the citation details in Mendeley Desktop or in your [web library](https://www.mendeley.com/library/). If you edit in Mendeley Desktop, you need to click **Sync** to upload your changes.

Then go back to Mendeley Cite and click **More > Refresh References** to update your citations.
