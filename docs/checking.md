# Checking details

The best way to check, correct and add details to a saved citation is to use Mendeley Desktop, particularly if you've saved a PDF.

If the citation has a PDF attached you'll see a small PDF icon in the third column, just before the title. Click this as the PDF will open up in a new tab, with the item details on the right.

Just click on any of the item details to edit the data. You can refer to the PDF on the left to check that the details are correct and, if the PDF allows it, you can copy and paste text into the details area.

?> You can also edit details in the web version of Mendeley - just click the item title in your library and then the **Edit** button at the top of the details.
