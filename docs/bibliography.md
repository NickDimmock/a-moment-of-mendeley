# Creating a bibliography

Once you've added some citations to your document, you can use Mendeley to automatically create a bibliography or reference list. This can be a huge time-saver,and ensures a consistent style.

?> Bibliography styles can be changed throughout your document at any time - see [Citation styles](styles) for details.

## Using Mendeley Desktop tools

To add a bibliography using the citation tools installed by Mendeley Desktop, start by putting your cursor where you want your bibliography to begin.

Open the **References** ribbon and click **Insert Bibliography** in the Mendeley section.

The bibliography may take a few seconds to appear if you've added a lot of citations.

?> You can add a bibliography at any time - you don't have to wait until you've finished writing. Any further citations you add to your document will automatically be added to the bibliography, in the correct order.

## Using Mendeley Cite

If you're using [Mendeley Cite](mendeley-cite), click **More > Insert Bibliography** and then **Continue** in the Mendeley Cite window to add a bibliography at the current cursor location.

?> As with the Desktop tools, you can add a bibliography at any stage - Mendeley Cite will keep it updated if you add or change citations.
