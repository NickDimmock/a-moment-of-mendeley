# Citation styles

When you start using Mendeley it will offer you several common citation styles to use in your documents. However, Mendeley supports hundreds of additional citation styles.

You can change the citation style used in your document at any time, and as many times as you like. There's no risk in trying a different style - if you don't think the new style works, you can just change back.

## A note on Harvard

Many researchers will be advised or required to use a Harvard style for referencing.

Unlike APA and MLA, there is no 'official' Harvard style - if you browse the style lists in Mendeley you'll see there are dozens and dozens of Harvard variants, each with its own features and approaches. If you want to use Harvard you may need to try a few different versions to find one that's a good fit. If you're a PhD researchers, your supervisor may be able to advise you on expected features.

## Using Mendeley Desktop tools

### Changing styles

If you're using the citation tools from Mendeley Desktop, go to the **References** ribbon and click the **Style** drop-down menu. You'll see the default style list.

?> It's a good idea to add a few sample references and a bibliography the first time you do this, so you can see how the style changes in your document.

As soon as you select a style, Mendeley will update your document to match the new style. You should see that your references and bibliography change in some way - some details may be in italics or capital letters, the order of elements in the bibliography may change, and so on.

!> The changes may sometimes be dramatic! For example, if you switch from a Harvard style to MHRA, all your in-text citations will change to footnotes. Don't worry if this happens - switch back to Harvard and they'll all be restored.

### Adding styles

If you can't find a style that suits you in the default list, you can install new ones.

At the bottom of the **Style** list you'll see **More Styles...**. Click this and a **Citation Styles** window will open up.

The **Get More Styles** tab will let you find new styles. It will initially be empty - you'll need to search for styles to add. If you don't have a specific style in mind, try searching for Harvard. A long list of matching styles should appear.

To add a style, click to highlight it and then click the **Install** button that appears. Move back to the **Installed** tab, click the style you just added, and then click the **Use this Style** button. Then click **Done** to return to Word with your new style applied.
