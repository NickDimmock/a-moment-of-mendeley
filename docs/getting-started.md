# Getting started with Mendeley

There are several ways to use Mendeley, so you can tailor it to the way you prefer to work. This page will take you through setting up all available features.

## Sign up

Sign up for a free account at [mendeley.com](https://mendeley.com).

?> It's best to use a personal email for this, rather than your university email. If you create a university account, some features may not be available.

## Download Mendeley Desktop

After signing up, you should be prompted to download [Mendeley Desktop](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop-new/) (follow the link if not).

Mendeley Desktop runs on your laptop or PC, where you can use it to save PDFs to your citation library.

An advantage of Mendeley Desktop is that your citation library will be available offline, so it's a good choice if you're working somewhere without internet access. It's also very useful for managing a local library of your PDFs.

!> macOS users should note that macOS Catalina is [not currently supported](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/29366/supporthub/mendeley/p/16075/). Check the [release notes](https://www.mendeley.com/release-notes/) for updates. I've found Mendeley Desktop does install and run in Catalina, but it may not behave as expected.

Mendeley guides for desktop can be found at [https://www.mendeley.com/guides/desktop](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/desktop).

### Log in to Desktop

When Mendeley Desktop is installed, run it and log in with the email and password you set earlier.

?> If you're using your own device, tick the **Stay signed in** box to avoid having to do this in future.

### Install Desktop tools

Mendeley Desktop has links to install two helper tools:

#### MS Word plugin

The Word plugin is a tool for adding your citations to Word, and generating a bibliography.

In Mendeley Desktop, go to **Tools > Install MS Word Plugin** to install the referencing tools for Word.

?> If you see **Uninstall MS Word Plugin** in the menu, it means the Word tools are already installed - this may happen during the install of Mendeley Desktop.

Installation usually only takes a second. You may be asked to close down Word and Outlook for this to work.

You can also use Mendeley Cite (see below) to add citations.

#### Web importer

The Web Importer adds a button to your browser that helps you capture citations online.

Go to **Tools > Install Web Importer** in Mendeley Desktop for instructions. You can also find [Web Importer details online](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/web-importer).

Web Importer requires [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/).

## Mendeley Cite

Mendeley Cite is an alternative way to add citations and bibliographies to Word. It has better integration with Word, but at the moment it's in beta (a testing phase), so features may change. Some features (such as searching for tags) are not yet implemented in Cite.

?> An advantage of Cite is that you can use it with the online version of Word at [office.com](https://office.com). It can also be a better option if you're using a Mac.

You can install Cite from Word. Go to the **Insert** ribbon and click **Store**, then search for **Mendeley**. In the results, click the **Add** button next to Mendeley Cite.

Mendeley also have [instructions for installing Cite](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/mendeley-cite).

?> You can install the Desktop citation tools and Mendeley Cite at the same time, but a Word document can only use one or the other. Try them both to see which you prefer.

## Official help

Mendeley has a great selection of [help guides](https://www.mendeley.com/guides) and [video tutorials](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/videos) to help you learn the basics.

A good video to start with is [Getting Started with Mendeley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6_HuCYExM).
